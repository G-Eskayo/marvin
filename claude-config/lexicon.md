## Meta

- **wire** — symlink skill into `~/.claude/commands/` + add to routing table. "Wire a skill" = make it active.
- **skill loop** — the self-improve cycle: observe pattern → quality filter → draft skill → wire it
- **quality filter** — the 3-gate check (recurrence, evidence, value) before codifying anything

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- **MCP** — open protocol for connecting AI applications to external systems (tools, data, workflows). Anthropic-originated, now community-governed. Think USB-C for AI.
- **MCP host** — the AI application that manages everything: creates clients, enforces security, coordinates LLM. Examples: Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code.
- **MCP client** — protocol-level component inside the host. One client = one dedicated connection to one server. Stateful session per server.
- **MCP server** — program that exposes capabilities (tools/resources/prompts) to clients. Can be local (stdio) or remote (HTTP). Focused, composable, isolated.
- **MCP primitive** — the typed building blocks of the protocol. Server-side: tools, resources, prompts. Client-side: sampling, elicitation, roots.
- **tool (MCP)** — model-controlled executable function. LLM decides when to call it. Schema-defined via JSON Schema. Requires `tools/list` discovery then `tools/call` execution.
- **resource (MCP)** — application-controlled read-only data source. URI-addressed (`file://`, `calendar://`, etc.). Supports direct URIs and parameterized templates. App decides how/when to include in context.
- **prompt (MCP)** — user-controlled reusable template. Requires explicit invocation (slash command, palette). Parameterized. Structures interactions with the LLM.
- **sampling** — client primitive: server asks the host LLM to generate a completion. Server stays model-independent. Human-in-the-loop by design — user sees and can approve/modify both request and response.
- **elicitation** — client primitive: server asks the user for structured input mid-operation. Schema-driven form (not free text). Used for confirmations, preferences, missing data.
- **roots** — client primitive: host tells server which filesystem directories are in scope. Advisory, not enforced. Prevents accidents, not malicious servers.
- **capability negotiation** — handshake at session init where client and server declare what they support. Determines which primitives and notifications are available for the session. Drives progressive enhancement.
- **lifecycle (MCP)** — initialize → initialized notification → active session → terminate. Stateful. Capability negotiation happens at initialize.
- **transport layer (MCP)** — communication mechanism between client and server. Two types: stdio (local, direct pipes, zero network overhead) and Streamable HTTP (remote, HTTP POST + optional SSE, OAuth auth).
- **data layer (MCP)** — JSON-RPC 2.0 based protocol for client-server message exchange. Defines lifecycle, primitives, notifications, utilities.
- **MCP notification** — fire-and-forget JSON-RPC message (no id field, no response expected). Used for real-time updates: `notifications/tools/list_changed`, `notifications/initialized`, etc.
- **MCP Tasks** — experimental extension for async/long-running operations. Server returns a task handle instead of blocking. Client polls `tasks/get`. States: working → input_required → completed/failed/cancelled. Crash-resilient via durable task IDs.
- **MCP Apps** — extension for interactive UI widgets rendered inline in chat (forms, pickers, dashboards). Extends servers beyond flat text responses.
- **MCPB (MCP Bundle)** — packaged local stdio server with its runtime bundled as a single `.mcpb` archive. Users install without needing Node/Python. For local-machine servers.
- **confused deputy (MCP)** — attack on MCP proxy servers: malicious client exploits static client ID + consent cookies at third-party auth server to steal authorization codes without user consent. Mitigated by per-client consent stored server-side before any third-party redirect.
- **token passthrough (MCP)** — forbidden anti-pattern: MCP server accepting tokens not issued for itself and forwarding them downstream. Breaks audit trails, bypasses security controls, enables privilege escalation.
- **MCP Registry** — central directory for discovering and publishing MCP servers. Servers are versioned and moderated.
- **SEP (Spec Enhancement Proposal)** — formal process for proposing changes to the MCP specification. Community-governed.
- **agent skill (MCP context)** — portable instruction set that gives AI coding assistants domain knowledge. `mcp-server-dev` plugin provides `build-mcp-server`, `build-mcp-app`, `build-mcpb` skills for scaffolding MCP servers.

- **title (MCP)** — human-readable display name on tools, resources, prompts. Separate from `name` (the unique identifier used in protocol calls). Show `title` to users; use `name` in tool calls.
- **instructions (MCP)** — optional string in server's `InitializeResult`. Guidance the host can pass to the LLM about how to use this server.
- **MCP endpoint** — single HTTP URL supporting both POST (client→server) and GET (server→client SSE stream) in Streamable HTTP transport. E.g. `https://example.com/mcp`.
- **MCP-Session-Id** — HTTP header for session management in Streamable HTTP. Cryptographically random (UUID/JWT). Client includes on all requests after init. Format used for secure binding: `<user_id>:<session_id>`.
- **MCP-Protocol-Version** — HTTP header client MUST include on all subsequent HTTP requests after init. Value = negotiated protocol version (e.g. `2025-11-25`).
- **resources/subscribe** — client subscribes to change notifications for a specific resource URI. Server sends `notifications/message` when that resource changes.
- **completions capability** — server capability for argument autocompletion. Supports `completion/complete` requests on prompt arguments and resource template parameters. E.g., typing "Par" → suggests "Paris".
- **parameter completion** — prompts and resource templates support completing partial argument values. Enables slash-command argument suggestions.
- **PKCE (MCP auth)** — Proof Key for Code Exchange. REQUIRED for all MCP OAuth flows. MUST use S256 method. If AS doesn't advertise `code_challenge_methods_supported` → client MUST refuse to proceed.
- **resource indicator (MCP)** — RFC 8707 `resource` parameter in OAuth auth/token requests. Binds token to specific MCP server URI. Clients MUST include; servers MUST validate audience claim matches.
- **Client ID Metadata Documents** — preferred MCP OAuth registration mechanism. Client uses HTTPS URL as `client_id`; AS fetches that URL to get client metadata (name, redirect_uris). No prior relationship needed.
- **Protected Resource Metadata** — RFC 9728. MCP servers MUST implement to advertise their authorization server location. Served at `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` or via `WWW-Authenticate` header on 401.
- **scope challenge** — WWW-Authenticate header with `error="insufficient_scope"` and `scope="..."`. Client responds with step-up authorization flow to get elevated token.
- **MCP endpoint (auth)** — MCP server acts as OAuth 2.1 resource server. Validates tokens for correct audience. MUST NOT accept tokens not issued for it. MUST NOT forward tokens to upstream APIs.
- **mcp-server-dev** — Claude plugin (`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`) providing `build-mcp-server`, `build-mcp-app`, `build-mcpb` skills. Entry point for scaffolding any MCP server.
- **MCPB (MCP Bundle)** — packaged local stdio server with its runtime bundled as a single `.mcpb` archive. Users install without needing Node/Python. For local-machine servers. (`build-mcpb` skill scaffolds these.)
- **Server Card** — upcoming MCP standard. `.well-known` URL exposing structured server metadata so browsers/crawlers/registries can discover capabilities without connecting. On roadmap.
- **MCP Registry** — official centralized metadata repository for public MCP servers. Reverse DNS naming (`io.github.user/server`). Stores metadata pointing to npm/PyPI/Docker packages. REST API for aggregators.
- **DNS rebinding (MCP)** — attack where malicious domain changes DNS to internal IP mid-request. MCP HTTP servers MUST validate `Origin` header (HTTP 403 if invalid). Servers SHOULD bind to localhost only.
- **logging (MCP)** — server capability to emit structured log messages to client via `notifications/message`. Eight RFC 5424 levels (debug through emergency). Client sets minimum level via `logging/setLevel`.
